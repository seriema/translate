  <h4>Why translate with Wikipedia?</h4>
  <p>
    Google Translate and other services are great at translating sentences. But sometimes you just want one specific word. Then it's hard to know if the translation is correct. Especially if it's a technical term in a certain area (like psychology or computer science) where common words mean something completely different.

  <p>
    Since Wikipedia is such a great encyclopedia it's a great source of these terms. Most articles are translated and checked by humans, so you can be fairly certain that the word you translated is the actual word you want.
