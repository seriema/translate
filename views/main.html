But sometimes you just want one specific word. Then it's hard to know if the translation is correct. Especially if it's a technical term in a certain area (like psychology or computer science) where common words mean something completely different. </p> <p> Since Wikipedia is such a great encyclopedia it's a great source of these terms. Most articles are translated and checked by humans, so you can be fairly certain that the word you translated is the actual word you want. </p> </div> </div>
